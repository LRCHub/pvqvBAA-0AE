Setting along the scenery, beneath the steady fall
The dusk accompanies a loneliness, descending as snow
Tears can drown the embers in this broken heart of mine
Another portrait in my life watching the seasons passing by

Tears can drown the embers in this broken heart of mine
Another portrait in my life watching the seasons passing by
Crystallizing every breath I take, even the subtle sighs
The wind carries a solemn melody through uncovered trees
At the red brick station the trains can catch their breath
And I've been patient, waiting for someone who won't come back to me
Whoa

Tonight the tears will go away, I'll find a way to play this Serenade
How can I break this song away from my emotions
The snow is falling down to kiss and help me reminisce and celebrate
My tears are falling from the sky and turns to White Love

By the time the bells are swinging in their rhythmic symphony
Imagining dreamy winter-land is where I will be
Angels all around, floating slowly from the sky
And bring a look of tenderness only
the spring can show me how (Whoa-Oh)

So I'll be holding strong and keep from going on to Loneliness
The glistening angels in the sky are waiting for me
And I will wish upon a star and carry in my heart for foreverness
These tears eventually will frost and turn to White Love

Tonight the tears will go away, I'll find a way to play this Serenade
How can I break this song away from my emotions
Give me one chance so I can shine
and reminisce the times and celebrate
My tears are falling from the sky and turn to White Love
White Love...
White Love...
White Love...

I just want to hold you
Can't be without you
I'm calling out your name
In my heart-hea-hea
